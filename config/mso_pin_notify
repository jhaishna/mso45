# Use this file to map an event to the policy opcode you want 
# Infranet to call when that event occurs.
# 
# After defining the events and the corresponding opcodes,
# run the 'load_pin_notify' utility to create the new config/notify
# storable object and load this notification list into the Infranet
# database. Then restart the Connection Manager for these changes
# to take effect. When the event occurs, the system passes the
# entire /event storable object as the input flist to the opcode.
#
# Use the following syntax for defining event notification:
#
# <opcode_number>  <opcode_flag>  <event>
#
# Where:
#  <opcode_number> is the identifying number of the policy opcode 
#       that you want called when the event occurs. You can find 
#       the identifying numbers for standard policy opcodes in the
#       pcm_ops.h file in the /include directory. For custom 
#       opcodes, define their numbers either in the pcm_ops.h file
#       or in a different header file that you link with the code.
#       The numbers from 1 through 10000 are reserved for standard
#       Infranet opcodes.
#  <opcode_flag> is the flag that is passed to the opcode when
#       Infranet calls the opcode.
#  <event> is the event that triggers the notification. You can use
#       standard event types or a custom event type, as long as
#       the event type has a corresponding /event storable
#       object in the database.
#
# Note: You can have more than one notification opcode for an
#       event. Infranet calls the opcodes in the order they appear
#       in the list.

# The following entries set up Infranet to automatically notify a
# customer by email about the status of their purchase order. When
# they approach their purchase order amount (threshold) or expiration
# date (datethreshold), the event calls the PCM_OP_ACT_POL_EVENT_NOTIFY
# opcode (#301), which sends the customer a reminder. When the
# customer exceeds the purchase order amount or the purchase order
# expires, the event calls the PCM_OP_ACT_POL_EVENT_LIMIT opcode
# (#304), which notifies the customer. This opcode can also deactivate
# the account.

# The following entries set up Infranet to automatically log the 
# the activities that need to be audited. this happens by calling the 
# opcode PCM_OP_ACT_LOG_USER_ACTIVITY(#179), which stores information in 
# user_activity storable class. Only activities that are 
# configured for auditing are recorded. The information that is tracked 
# is the type of activity, the date and time and the IP Address of the 
# client machine are stored on the server side.Later if the user wants to 
# more information then he can customize it by using the policy opcode
# PCM_OP_ACT_POL_LOG_USER_ACTIVITY.
