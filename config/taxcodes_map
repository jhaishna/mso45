#                "mm/dd/yy".  Example, "02/27/00".

#   List ....... Jurisdiction list of values this rate is applicable for.
#                This is similar to a "nexus" for the corresponding 
#                jurisdiction level.  For example, if "Lvl=Fed", then 
#                possible values could be:

#   Descr ...... Text description of the tax.
#   Rule ....... Tax rule.  Determines how taxes will be computed. Values are:
#                  Std   - Standard tax computation. Taxes are computed
#                          based on the 'taxable amount', and then added
#                          to the total.
#                  Tax   - 'Tax on tax' computation. Taxes are computed
#                          based on previous 'taxable amounts' and taxes,
#                          and then added to the total.
#                  NCS   - Non-comulative standard tax computation. Taxes
#                          are computed based on the 'taxable amount',
#                          but are not added to the total.
#                  NCT   - Non-comulative standard tax computation. Taxes
#                          are computed based on previous 'taxable 
#                          amounts' and taxes, but are not added to the
#                          total.
